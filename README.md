# Build an Emotion Detection Model using CNN - with Keras
* Simply put, we wish to build a highly accurate gender detection model that takes human image as input, and returns the emotion or facial expression for the subject in that input image. We are using Convolutional Neural Network based Deep Learning for model training.
* With this emotion detection model, we are asking a computer to do what a human could anyway do, but at insane scale. So, we would need to put a lot of our human sense into the model we would develop.
* During the course of this project, you shall get a first hand sense of how a data scientist thinks and works towards solving a technical problem of this scale and complexity.
